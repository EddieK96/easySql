# EasySql (Version: 0.9 Inception)
All functions included are designed to be simple to use with no required understanding of sql syntax. 

# Requirements
This is a wrapper for mysql-asymc, thus it is a requirement for this resource to work.

# The Difference
Instead of passing query strings you use lua tables that correspond to the changes in your database. Everything else is done "under the hood" for you.

# The Downside
If you have experience in handling databases, chances are you have no need for this resource. The goal of this repository is to give beginners and amateurs an easy solution to store and retrieve information.
